Folders:

(1) Extra_function: the folder contains the codes of general functions used in most of the analysis.

(2) Connectivity: contains the codes to estimate the connectivity between pollination and seed dispersal mutualism.

(3) Modularity: contains the codes to estimate modularity of networks, the structural role of species and their change between treatments. Also, contains the codes to compare the observed number of modules to values generated by shuffling the network with a null model.

(4) Stability: contains the codes to estimate the propagation after a particular disturbance event and the tolerance of the network to continued disturbances before collapsing (robustness). Also, it contains the codes to compare them between treatments.

(5) Extra_Analysis: the folder contains the codes to test if the patterns found in the extinction models were sensitive to the parameter "dependence on the mutualisms assigned to species". Also, it contains the codes to run the extinction simulation controlling for the network size.

(6) Data: contains the data to perform the analysis.
